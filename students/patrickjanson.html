		<h2>Hi  - I am Patrick Janson</h2>
		<p>
			I am attending the Flatiron School for Ruby on Rails. 
			</br>
			</br>
			I was previously a Senior Associate at a private equity fund where I served on the fund's investment commitee for over 4 years. 
			</br>
			</br>
			I spend my free time skateboarding and working on an iOS app I published this year.
			</br>
			</br>
			I have a soft spot for sci-fi, played professional sports, and spend a good amount of time playing chess games in central park.
			</br>
			</br>
			I studied Political Economy and Logic at the University of Colorado.
